          <p className='text-[1.5em] text-gray-700'> Jessica helped me very last minute with an online and in-person workshop where she was required to teach 100+ people to draw goats. After explaining why goats and why a drawing lesson, Jessica created various exercises that were absolutely perfect for our audience and culture (which is very unique). She incorporated everything we had hoped for plus some and made drawing a difficult live specimen super fun and enriching. Jess was super responsive, polite and professional. I wouldnâ€™t hesitate booking Jess again. Thanks Jess! </p>
